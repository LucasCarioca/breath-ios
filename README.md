Breath is an app for tracking breathing rates for pets with Mitral Valve disease and Congestive Hearth Failure.

My girlfriend and I recently faced this with on of our pets and had to track breathing rates manually. To help I created
the website [countmybreaths.com](https://countmybreaths.com). It was simple but got the job done. This app is the iOS
version with many more features build in.
